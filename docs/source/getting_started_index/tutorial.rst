Tutorial
========

Now that you learned what is meant with model validation you can play around with *Dymoval*.
The best way to take familiarity with *Dymoval* is to run any tutorial by typing

.. code-block::

    import dymoval as dmv
    dmv.open_tutorial()


To open the tutorial the following commands are used:
    - `start /path/to/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb` on Windows
    - `open /path/to/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb` on MacOSX
    - `xdg-open /path/to/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb` on Linux

Be sure that you can open .ipynb files with such commands.
