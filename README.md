## What is it?

**Dymoval**  (**Dy**namic **Mo**del **Val**idation) is a Python package for  *validating models* and *analyzing datasets*. 

*Dymoval* evaluates the goodness of your models, indipendently of the tool you used for developing them.

All you need to do is to feed the tool with both real-world measurements and model-generated data. 
In response, you will get an evaluation of your model in terms of r-squared fit, residuals norms and coverage region.

This means that if you are developing your models in a CI/CD environment, then *Dymoval* can help you in evaluating if to merge or not to merge some pull requests.
Please note that *Dymoval* functions can be easily included in development pipelines scripts, so the whole CI/CD process can be fully automatized.


*Dymoval* further provides some essential functions for dealing with dataset analysis and manipulation.  

Although it is a tool thought for engineering tasks, no one prevents you to use it in other application domains as well. 



## Main Features

 **Datasets analysis and manipulation**
- Time and frequency analysis 
- Missing data handling
- Linear filtering
- Means and offsets removal
- Re-sampling

**Model validation**

- Models unit-tests
- Validation metrics:
	- R-square
	- Residuals auto-correlation
	- Input-Residuals cross-correlation 
- Coverage region
- Works for both SISO and MIMO models
- Modeling tool independency
- Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines.


## Installation
By running 

    pip install dymoval

everything should workd, but there are few things to keep in mind.

Typically `conda` handles scientific packages better than `pip`, and given that many *dymoval* dependencies are scientific packages, it is suggested to install all the dependencies through `conda` and then to install *dymoval* through `pip`.

To do that, download the `environment.yml` file from [here](https://github.com/VolvoGroup/dymoval/blob/main/environment.yml) and run 

    conda env update --name env_name --file environment.yml
    pip install dymoval

where `env_name` is the environment name where you want to install *dymoval*.
If not provided, *dymoval* will be installed in a new environment called `dymoval`.

#### Why not `conda install dymoval`?
Unfortunately, it is not possible (yet?) to easily build `conda` packages when the project is handled thorugh a `pyproject.toml` file, and therefore the *dymoval* package, which uses a `pyproject.toml` file, is only available through `pip`.


#### Installation From this repo
Clone this repo and run

	cd /path/to/where/you/cloned/this/repo
	conda env update --name env_name --file environment.yml
    conda actiate env_name
	pip install .

or 

	cd /path/to/where/you/cloned/this/repo
	pip install .


## Getting started

If you are already familiar with model validation, then the best way to get started with dymoval is to run the tutorial scripts that you can open with

	import dymoval as dmv
	dmv.open_tutorial()


This will create a jupyter notebook in your `home` folder called `dymoval_tutorial.ipynb`.

For more info on what is model validation and what is currently implemented in *dymoval* along with the *dymoval* complete API, you can check the [docs](https://volvogroup.github.io/dymoval/).
