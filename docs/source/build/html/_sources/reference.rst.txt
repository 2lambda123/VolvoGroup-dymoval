As seen, the ingredients for validating a model are the *model* itself, a *dataset* and some *validation metrics*.
Given that *dymoval* is not a modeling tool, then its focus areas are the following

- :doc:`./reference_index/dataset`
- :doc:`./reference_index/validation`

-----------------
*Dymoval*'s package is arranged in the following modules

.. currentmodule:: dymoval
